# Paper Title

CodeGRITS: A Research Toolkit for Developer Behavior and Eye Tracking in IDE

# Purpose of Artifact

[CodeGRITS](https://codegrits.github.io/CodeGRITS/) is designed for empirical software engineering researchers, especially those interested in studying developers' programming behaviors. It is a plugin for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm, etc.) that collects developer IDE interactions and eye-tracking data, and exports them into XML files. It also includes several practical features including screen recording, dynamic configuration, activity labeling, etc.

# Claiming Badges

We claim both **Artifacts Available** and **Artifacts Evaluated â€“ Reusable** badges for this artifact. We also apply for the **Results Reproduced** badge.

# Technology Skills

We prepare the artifact via VirtualBox VM image (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS). The VM has 8GB of base memory and 4 CPU cores. No special technology skills are required, but the PC who is familiar with IntelliJ IDEA is strongly recommended.

The PC that has a Tobii Pro Fusion eye tracker is not required. CodeGRITS could use the mouse to simulate the eye tracker. We believe it would not affect the evaluation results.
